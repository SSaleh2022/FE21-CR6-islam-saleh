        <p>The rates displayed on our Platform are set by the Service Providers. We may finance rewards or other benefits out of our own pocket. When you make a Booking, you agree to pay the cost of the Travel Experience itself and any other charges and
            taxes that may apply (e.g. for any extras). Taxes and fees may vary for different reasons, such as the Service Provider’s location, the kind of room selected and the number of guests. The price description tells you whether any taxes and charges
            are included or excluded. You’ll be able to find more information about the price while you’re booking. Our Platform provides descriptions of any equipment and facilities that Service Providers offer (based on what they tell us). It also tells
            you how much extra they’ll cost, if anything.</p>
